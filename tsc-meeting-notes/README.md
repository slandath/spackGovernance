# Spack Technical Steering Committee Meetings

This page contains links to technical steering committee meetings notes.

TSC Meeting notes are (so far) maintained in a single google doc:

* [TSC Meeting Notes Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Qetgh1WuXw9Fw4HWjCR9Wq2e9gcD4pVGwnXEDikSng/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u2jlg6amiko2)

There is a template at the bottom that we follow for each new meeting.

You can propose agenda items for the TSC in two ways:

1. [Create a TSC Proposal issue](https://github.com/spack/governance/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=tsc-proposal.md&title=%5BTSC+Agenda%5D)
   on this repository, or
2. Discuss your issue proposal in `#technical-steering-committee` in Spack Slack (see [slack.spack.io](https://slack.spack.io))
